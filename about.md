By-product of an immersive coding bootcamp, up and coming frontend web developer with over 15 years experience in project management, data operations and business operations.

I've been involved with technologies ever since I started my career in the US in the late 90s. I like to build things, whether a project plan, a test strategy, a process improvement document or writing user manuals. I'm familiar with software development so it is only befitting that I've decided to switch careers to become a front end web developer. In the advent of IoT, I'd like to be intimate with developing software that improve user experience, has a large impact and improve people's lives while solving problems along the way.

## What I’ve worked on ##

 - Part of a team that successfully implemented New Hampshire's Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) in Production and its subsequent CMS certification a year later.
 - Worked on various projects involving process improvement, data validation and automation.
 - Project managed deployment of web applications and client implementations
 - Developed a **MySQL** customer database to store customer data and orders
 - Developed a **MS Access** database to store health coach licensure contact hours and end user reports

## I’m really good at ##

 - Listening
 - Validation/testing since I'm detail oriented (can spot differences given two images)
 - Communicating in all levels of organization
 - Building things
 - Adapting to change

## Coding Methodology ##
My philosophy in life is keep it simple. I apply the same tactic in solving complex problems by breaking things in small chunks when coding then prioritizing them. This makes things more manageable in release management, shortens SDLC and allows one to be nimble in responding to new features or bugs.

## What I’m looking to do next ##
Looking to join a growing company as part of the engineering team to apply newly acquired skills in web development by collaborating with others to solve problems that create rich, interactive and robust web applications that enhances user experience. I would thrive in a culture that celebrates diversity, encourages mentorships, highly collaborative, promotes transparency and values work/life balance. A culture that sees potential in talent and provides support so they can succeed and contribute more to the company vision would be a great fit.

From professional development perspective, the next goal is to tackle back-end development especially since I can leverage my database/data knowledge background. Goal is to learn Python, React.js or any other technology that my future employer sees fit to meet business need.

## Hobbies ##
When not coding, enjoy outdoor activities like tennis, hiking, walking, biking and skiing. Have known to occasionally binge watch 80's music videos on YouTube.

## Soft Skills ##
People person, consensus builder, methodological thinker, highly organized, detail oriented, collaborator, naturally curious, flexible, quick study, proactive, tenacious, can think on one's feet, easily adapts to situations (i.e. content is like water in RWD).

## Personal anecdotes ##
Did you know that I was able to navigate entire arduous process from F1 to H1 to final US citizenship through self-advocacy and tenacity ?

Did you know that I was able to parlay an unpaid internship into a 9 year progressive career path at a growing company through hard work and determination ?

Did you know that I once went hang gliding ?

***Now that you know about me, will you extend the invitation for me to get to know you?***
