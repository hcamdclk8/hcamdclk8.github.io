## Bloc Capstone Project for Alexa ##

I wanted to share why I chose to work on an Alexa skill set for my final Bloc project and what it will be about. I picked
Alexa since not only have done 5 skills that have been certified by Amazon but more importantly I firmly believe it is
the next big platform that will disrupt computing. I believe the platform of voice recognition is still emerging and has
not yet reached its full potential yet.
