## Bloc Capstone Project for Alexa ##

I wanted to share why I chose to work on an Alexa skill set for my final Bloc project and what it will be about. I picked
Alexa since not only have done 5 skills that have been certified by Amazon but more importantly I firmly believe it is
the next big platform that will disrupt computing. I believe the platform of voice recognition is still emerging and has
not yet reached its full potential yet. Any media attention its getting now is not based on 'hype' but real practical application of Alexa and personally predict will invade American homes in the next year or two.

Once I've decided on this, the next step was to decide what it will do. I chose to work on having Alexa provide air quality for major US cities to interested users. This was a simple choice for two reasons, one is that I grew up with asthma and the quality of air we breathe has major impact on the severity of asthma attacks. Second is that one of my interests is health 
and well being. Having more than 10 years working in the healthcare tech was no mere coincidence, I believe in healthy living and healthy lifestyle. We are what we eat, what we do and what we think.
