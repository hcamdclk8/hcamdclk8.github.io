## Integrating Slack with Heroku via API##

I wanted to share my experience with how to integrate an app that sends what's trending in GitHub to Slack via an API. It was
great experience and much credit goes to Matt who shared a great [implementation plan](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2016/3/9/how-to-deploy-your-slack-bots-to-heroku].)
that gets one up and running in under an hour.

A few errors that I made that hopefully by highlighting here will prevent others from stubbling in the same manner and 
make the deployment smoother.

1. Be conscious about typos - I made the error with this code `$ heroku config:set STARBOT_COMMAND_TOKEN` and instead
typed STAR**_T_**BOT_COMMAND_TOKEN with the extra *T*.

2. Naming the apps in Heroku is optional - if you intend not to name it, make sure you skip the text within the brackets. Type 
`$ heroku create` instead of `$ heroku create {optional-app-name}`.

3. Heroku automatically assigns a name to your app if you did not give it one - Make note of this name, and when it comes time to
configure Slack, make sure to use the assigned app name instead of *starbot-example* here : `URL http://starbot-example.herokuapp.com/commands/starbot`

By sharing these tips, hopefully it will save one time in troublshooting and focus instead on the glory of seeing your 
creation come alive before your eyes. Happy coding!
