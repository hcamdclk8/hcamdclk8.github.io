## Designing and Testing Air Quality Meter ##

My [previous](http://hcamdclk8.github.io/capstone/) post detailed why I chose Alexa to build final Bloc project and rational why I picked air quality meter as my skill to work on. With this post, I will share the 'how' - what went on as I built and tested this skill. The prevailing approach and guiding principle I utilized was K.I.S.S. - Keep It Simple Stupid which is a life philosophy that I adhere to.

1. Choose a service - there are several services such as communicating to database (i.e DynamoDB) or sending email that can be incorporated with Alexa. I chose API service for two reasons. The first is it is widely used by web apps to exchange data so it is relevant in the workplace. Second, since data management/data processing is a strong suit of mine prior to becoming a developer, its just was a natural choice.

2. Define user stories or core user requirements - for this stage, I went the scrappy route. By this I mean I went back to old school paper and pen to list it down using the complimentary notebook that Bloc provided to their students. This is what I came up with :

  - It will use a one shot model instead of dialog.
  - Alexa will provide air quality rating when user provides a 5 digit zip code. 
  - API service must have good and easy to follow documentation that is up-to-date.

3. Designing the skill - for this step, I had to do research other
4. Develop
5. Testing plan
3. Unit Testing
4. Prepare test data
4. Functional Testing
5. Final code clean up
6. Documentation
7. gather periphenail for AMZN cert
