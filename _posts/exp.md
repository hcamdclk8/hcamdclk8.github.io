## Designing and Testing Air Quality Meter ##

My previous post detailed why I chose Alexa to build final Bloc project and rational why I picked air quality meter as my
skill to work on. On this post, I will share the 'how' by sharing what went on as I built and tested this skill. The prevailing approach and guiding principle I utilized was K.I.S.S. - Keep It Simple Stupid which is a life philosophy that I 
adhere to.

1. Choose a service
2. Define user stories and core functional requirements
3. Design code/research
4. Develop
5. Testing plan
3. Unit Testing
4. Prepare test data
4. Functional Testing
5. Final code clean up
6. Documentation
7. gather periphenail for AMZN cert
